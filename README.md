# CSR-Racing-2

**Notes:**<br>
① If you find a new variant of a car, please join the Discord server and let me know. I will update it as soon as possible. Usually I have to check and maintain all the cars by myself so the workload is very heavy. If I get everyone's help, my workload will be reduced a lot. This project is free for the players. I hope everyone can participate actively.<br>
